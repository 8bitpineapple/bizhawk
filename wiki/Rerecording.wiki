==Loadstate Errors==

 * GUID Mismatch Error

All movies have a unique GUID.  Savestates store this value.  In the event of a mismatch this error will occur.  It is a soft error in that it will ask the user if they wish to proceed.

 * Timeline Error
 
When loading a state in Read-only mode, a timeline check will occur.  Each frame of the savestate and the movie will be compared.  If the savestate deviates from the movie this error will occur.  It will also notify the frame at which the savestate branches from the current movie.

 * Future Event Error

When loading a state in Read-only mode, if the savestate from an event after the end of the movie, this error will be thrown.  You can not load an event that has not yet occurred in the movie!
